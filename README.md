## ✨ What’s New in V3



### 🧭 Multicluster Workspace with Multi-Window Support
With K8Studio V3, you can now open and manage **multiple clusters simultaneously**. Thanks to the new **Multi-Window Docking Layout Manager**, you can open as many tabs as needed—across any cluster—and fully customize your workspace. Arrange views side by side, or stack them in tabs to **monitor and work with multiple clusters in parallel**, all within a single, unified interface.

### 🗂️ Customizable Docking Layout
Our powerful Docking Layout Manager gives you full control over your workspace. Open multiple windows, drag and drop views, and organize panels to match your workflow. Build the perfect multi-cluster dashboard with ease.

### 🤖 AI Copilot – Context-Aware Kubernetes Assistant
K8Studio V3 now includes an integrated **AI Copilot**, designed to assist you intelligently based on your current selection and workspace context. Whether you're editing YAML, reviewing logs, or troubleshooting a deployment, Copilot gathers relevant data—like object definitions, logs, and configuration files—to provide targeted help.

Ask questions, generate YAML, resolve errors, or get best-practice guidance—all powered by a Kubernetes-aware AI assistant that works inside the application.


### 📊 Overview Panel
The all-new **Cluster Overview Page** gives you a real-time summary of key metrics like **CPU**, **memory**, and **pod usage**. View resource requests, limits, and actual consumption at a glance to monitor cluster health and performance.
